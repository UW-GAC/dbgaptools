Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Nelson", "Sarah", email = "sarahcn@uw.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package can create or check dataset and data dictionary files for the required dbGaP submission elements: sample-subject mapping, sample attributes, and subject consent files. Optionally, pedigree and phenotype files can be checked for presence of expected subjects. (say something about TOPMed as motivating use case to create?)
